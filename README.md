# Agro_Ecology_Seminar
As part of my degree in Agroecology and Plant Health, I submitted a seminar paper on the topic -

The use of Decision Support Systems (DSS) for pest management and diseases on a regional scale.

Aside from the PowerPoint and the abstract I gave a 15-minute presentation with the slideshow.
